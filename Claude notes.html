This file is not giving the user the ability to reinstall the tool, if the tool detects that it is already installed.

Have the tool reinstall the scripts if it detects that they are already installed.

The shelf selection process: The user is given a drop down menu to select the shelf for the installation of the tool shelf buttons and the icons that go with these buttons, but it is not installing those buttons on the shelf. It is currently installing a new shelf called GameDev and adding the buttons to this shelf, ignoring the user input of where to place the buttons. This needs to be fixed in the launcher code.

When the shelf buttons are executed, they are giving the following errors in Maya:

import conestoga_playblast; conestoga_playblast.show_ui()

# Error: module 'conestoga_playblast' has no attribute 'show_ui'

# # Traceback (most recent call last):

# #   File "<maya console>", line 1, in <module>

# # AttributeError: module 'conestoga_playblast' has no attribute 'show_ui'

import conestoga_playblast; conestoga_playblast.create_playblast()

# Error: module 'conestoga_playblast' has no attribute 'create_playblast'

# # Traceback (most recent call last):

# #   File "<maya console>", line 1, in <module>

# # AttributeError: module 'conestoga_playblast' has no attribute 'create_playblast'

Fix these errors in the code of the appropriate script to launch the tool. Use the scripts that are listed in this project.
